## About me
My name is Federico and I'm the founder of **[Code Palace](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodePalace/)**, a brand that teaches anyone that has access to a computer how to code and build modern applications _without a fancy degree, or an expensive education_.

```swift
let status = "Currently building apps for iOS!"
print(status)
```
