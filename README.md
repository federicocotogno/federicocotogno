## About me :writing_hand:

Hey there! I'm Federico, the brain behind **Code Palace**. I'm a self-taught programmer who loves to create powerful scripts in Python to further simplify everyday life. Feel free to explore my projects, and even build upon them!

## Can I use your code for my own projects? :computer:

You are **100%** free to use my projects for whatever you want. Even if you make money off of them, I'm fine with that! ðŸ’¸
