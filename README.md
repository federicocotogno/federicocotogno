### About me

Hello world! I'm Federico, and I'm a course instructor at **Code Palace**. I've been teaching programming concepts since 2019 and I love it not only because it helps thousands of people around the world to create something great, but also because it gives me the opportunity to really dive deep into a subject and to make sure I understand it.
