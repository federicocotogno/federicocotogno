## About me :writing_hand:

Hey there! I'm Federico, the brain behind **Code Palace**. I'm a self-taught programmer who loves to create powerful scripts in Python to further simplify everyday life. Feel free to explore my projects, and even build upon them!

## Can I use your code for my own projects? üñãÔ∏è

You are **100%** free to use my projects for whatever you want! But also remember to do some research on the packages/dependencies I use, because some of those might contain some legal information in terms of usage.
