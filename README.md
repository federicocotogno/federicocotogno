## About me :writing_hand:

#### Who am I?

Hey there! I'm Federico, and I'm a course instructor at **Code Palace**. I've been teaching programming concepts since 2019 and I love it not only because it helps thousands of people around the world to create something great, but also because it gives me the opportunity to really dive deep into a subject and to make sure I understand it.

#### Can I use your code for my own projects? üñãÔ∏è

You are **100%** free to use my projects for whatever you want! But also remember to do some research on the packages/dependencies I use, because some of those might contain some legal information in terms of usage.

#### Social Media
