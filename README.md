## About me
My name is Federico and I'm a self taught developer and founder **[Code Palace](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodePalace/)**, a brand that teaches anyone that has access to a computer how to code and build modern applications without a fancy degree, or an expensive education.

```swift
let text = "Learn to code for free!"
print(text)
```

## What I teach
Currently I'm teaching native iOS development with SwiftUI. I also really enjoy teaching how to create powerful scripts with Python that simplify everyday life. 

_You can find out more about what I teach **[here](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodePalace/)**._

```python


def makeMoney():
    money = 0
    while True:
          money += 1
    
makeMoney()
```
